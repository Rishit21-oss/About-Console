    <h2> Visual Studio Code </h2>
    <p> The code of the editor is completely Open Source, and there's no payment required to use it. 
    It uses Electron as its base, which enables it to be cross platform and work on Mac, Windows and 
    Linux. It's built using Node. js, and you can extend it using JavaScript (which makes it a win for
    all us JavaScript developers). </p>
    <h3> Getting started with Visual Studio Code </h3>

    <h2> Console </h2>
    <p> The console. log() is a function that writes a message to log on the debugging console, such 
        as Webkit or Firebug. In a browser you will not see anything on the screen. It logs a message 
        to a debugging console. It is only available in Firefox with Firebug and in Webkit based 
        browsers (Chrome and Safari).
